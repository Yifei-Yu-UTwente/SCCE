Hi, all! I am excited to inform you that I graduated with a Cum Laude at the University of Twente. Everything went very well!
</p>

Your support and feedback made this thesis possible with solid evidence from the industry. This is one of the most important reasons why this work is unique. Some of you joined the ceremony and received my book. For those who did not join, I here provide you with a summary in Dutch.

<h2 class="section-heading">2. Research</h2>

<p>
Starting in 2025, I continue my research in Circular Economy as a senior researcher at the University of Twente. I focus on the European Project of From Industrial Symbiosis to Hubs for Circularity.
</p>

<p>
In this project, I extend my scope to the overall circular transition in different industries. Taking the construction industry as an anchor industry, I aim to discover new circular opportunities in different sectors. But this is not easy. We need to carefully manage materials, money, and people around new opportunities. Therefore, many interesting and focused research topics are included. I am here to help you if your organisations need any research support or advice.
