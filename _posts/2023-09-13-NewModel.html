Hello, everyone! We are excited to announce another major update of the PhD programme: Smart Circular Construction Ecosystems. Now, we developed a matchmaking simulation model as a potential function of the Circularity Information Platform. In this update, you will read: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A recap of what we did; </li>
  <li> Brief explanation of the model; </li>
  <li> Model demonstration; </li>

</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">1.A Recap of What We Did</h2>

<p>
To support the Circular Economy (CE) transition in the built environment, we provide digital technology solutions. One important solution is to develop an integrated information platform where different stakeholders can work together across the whole life cycle of an asset. 
</p>

<p>
Among many functions that the platform can provide, the most important function is to enable “waste-to-resource” matchmaking. In other words, we want to find the circular material connections between old and new assets. We want to manage circular buildings at a larger scale beyond the boundary of one individual project.

<p>
However, it is not as easy as selling or buying a product from a second-hand market. We are talking about building materials and components, and they have their own characteristics in a unique construction culture background. Starting from the complicated reality, we are blocked by many limitations and questions: How to ensure material quality? How to convince users to use the platform? How to tackle regulation barriers? What happens to the logistics? How much cost will be made? How to check if what you see is what you get? …
</p>

<p>
After a long debate and brainstorming, we realised that we were going nowhere. Haunted by these wicked challenges, we need to find a way out. 
</p>

<p><b>
“What if we take an opposite direction? Let’s start from scratch and move towards the reality!”
</b></p>

<p>
Instead of considering too many restrictions at the beginning, we decided to imagine a wonderland without any restrictions. Then, step by step, we add realistic features to this wonderland and discover its value all the way back to reality. This is what we did, simply create a simulation model that mimics the real situation from a particular point of view. Using this model as an experimental ground, we test different strategies and interventions hypothetically, just like a chess game (<b>Fig. 1</b>).
