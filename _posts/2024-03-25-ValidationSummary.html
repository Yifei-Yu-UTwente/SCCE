<p>
Hello, dear participants! First, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of you. Thank you so much for attending the validation sessions and offering your feedback.
</p>

<p>
In this update, you are going to read the following key points:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> What did we do? </li>
  <li> How does the model perform? </li>
  <li> Do you agree with these results? </li>
  <li> Summary </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. What did we do?</h2>

<p>
In the past few months, we conducted several validation sessions with different participants. The major steps of each session are listed as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Explain the design background; </li>
  <li> Demonstrate the model; </li>
  <li> Discuss and collect feedback; </li>
  <li> Fill in the evaluation form. </li>
</ul>

<p>
To help you remember what the model looks like, two screenshots of the model are provided as follows:

<h2 class="section-heading">2. How does the model perform?</h2>

<p>
The evaluation form includes the statements as follows:
</p>

<p>
<b> A -- Clarity </b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A1: It is clear to me what the model is developed for. </li>
  <li> A2: It is clear to me what the agent’s architecture is. </li>
  <li> A3: It is clear to me what the simulation environment is. </li>
  <li> A4: It is clear to me what the temporal (time) factors are. </li>
  <li> A5: It is clear to me what the spatial (space) factors are. </li>
</ul>
