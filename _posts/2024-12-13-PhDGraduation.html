<p>
Hi, all! I am excited to inform you that I graduated with a Cum Laude at the University of Twente. Everything went very well!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. Thesis</h2>

<p>
You can find my thesis via: <a href="https://doi.org/10.3990/1.9789036563970">https://doi.org/10.3990/1.9789036563970</a>

Your support and feedback made this thesis possible with solid evidence from the industry. This is one of the most important reasons why this work is unique. Some of you joined the ceremony and received my book. For those who did not join, I here provide you with a summary in Dutch.

<h2 class="section-heading">2. Research</h2>

<p>
Starting in 2025, I continue my research in Circular Economy as a senior researcher at the University of Twente. I focus on the European Project of From Industrial Symbiosis to Hubs for Circularity.
</p>

<p>
In this project, I extend my scope to the overall circular transition in different industries. Taking the construction industry as an anchor industry, I aim to discover new circular opportunities in different sectors. But this is not easy. We need to carefully manage materials, money, and people around new opportunities. Therefore, many interesting and focused research topics are included. I am here to help you if your organisations need any research support or advice.

<h2 class="section-heading">3. Education</h2>

<p>
I also take the role of a young teacher to educate future talents at the university. The courses are Circular Sustainable Business Development and Circular Economy Transition. I help students to learn circularity basics by playing educational games. Soon, more students will work on their graduation projects in sustainability and circularity. Maybe we can find a nice collaboration together with you and students.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">4. Myself</h2>
    
<p>
I am happy to stay in the Twente region and keep doing research that I like. The budget cut at the university creates uncertainties. But I receive funding from the European Commission directly, therefore, I feel safe about my work for now.
</p>

<p>
Nobody can foresee the future when the world is so dynamic. But I find a peaceful place in my mind. Like what I always do, I work hard and care for people. I am confident that society will treat me well in return.
</p>

<p>
I am currently living in Enschede nearby the tennis club ELTC on Pathmossingel street. I have been playing tennis for years and I am a member of the maintenance team in this club. If you cannot find me in the office, you then find me in tennis.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">5. Ending</h2>

<p>
It is important to have consistency in knowledge and partnership. This is the foundation for trust. I believe our knowledge and partnership have great potential in the future based on what we know about each other. I want to change my role from an academy sitting opposite you to a reliable partner walking beside your shoulders together.
</p>

<p>
Thank you again for everything!
