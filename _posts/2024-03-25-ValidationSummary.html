<p>
Hello, dear participants! First, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of you. Thank you so much for attending the validation sessions and offering your feedback.
</p>

<p>
In this update, you are going to read the following key points:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> What did we do? </li>
  <li> How does the model perform? </li>
  <li> Do you agree with these results? </li>
  <li> Summary </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. What did we do?</h2>

<p>
In the past few months, we conducted several validation sessions with different participants. The major steps of each session are listed as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Explain the design background; </li>
  <li> Demonstrate the model; </li>
  <li> Discuss and collect feedback; </li>
  <li> Fill in the evaluation form. </li>
</ul>

<p>
To help you remember what the model looks like, two screenshots of the model are provided as follows:

<h2 class="section-heading">2. How does the model perform?</h2>

<p>
The evaluation form includes the statements as follows:
</p>

<p>
<b> A -- Clarity </b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A1: It is clear to me what the model is developed for. </li>
  <li> A2: It is clear to me what the agent’s architecture is. </li>
  <li> A3: It is clear to me what the simulation environment is. </li>
  <li> A4: It is clear to me what the temporal (time) factors are. </li>
  <li> A5: It is clear to me what the spatial (space) factors are. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b> B -- Validity </b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> B1: I think the model represents possible matchmaking dynamics in reality. </li>
  <li> B2: I think the model animation shows the matchmaking dynamics at multiple levels of detail. </li>
  <li> B3: I think the model shows a phenomenon that is difficult to observe in reality. </li>
  <li> B4: I think the model’s structure is logical and coherent. </li>
  <li> B5: I think the model’s outputs are understandable and reasonable. </li>
  <li> B6: I think the model captures the randomness of matchmaking in reality. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b> C -- Functionality </b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> C1: The model is useful to explain the concept of circular matchmaking in the built environment at an urban level. </li>
  <li> C2: The model is useful to demonstrate the process and mechanism of circular matchmaking over space and time. </li>
  <li> C3: The model is useful for predicting the potential phenomenon of circular matchmaking under different scenarios. </li>
  <li> C4: The model is useful for predicting the potential effect of circularity hubs at different locations. </li>
  <li> C5: The model helps users to learn Circular Economy beyond the boundary of individual projects. </li>
  <li> C6: The model can serve as an educational tool to facilitate Circular Economy learning. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b> D -- Summary </b>
</p>

<ul>
<li> D1: Because of the model, I have a new perspective on Circular Economy in the built environment. </li>
<li> D2: Overall, it is interesting to know the model. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Based on the evaluation form and statements, the Likert-scale feedback is collected and presented in Figure 1.

<h2 class="section-heading">3. Do you agree with these results?</h2>

<p>
We analysed the feedback and dialogues. Then, we outlined several key statements and findings from the results above. Now, we ask for your extra confirmation and remarks. Since we had the discussion a while ago, it is helpful to revisit the key points with a refreshed mind. It is believed that an extra round of feedback helps to achieve the objectives as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Summarise what is known; </li>
<li> Present a clearer picture of the topic; </li>
<li> Correct misunderstandings; </li>
<li> Pick up overlooked points; </li>
<li> Delve into the topic to a further extent. </li>
</ul>

<p>
We highlight the key points and ask for your further feedback in two aspects: (1) What the model can do now, and (2) What the model can do in the future. Could you please review these highlights and fill in the form below?

<h2 class="section-heading">4. Summary</h2>

<p>
Thank you so much for your time and feedback! We enjoyed the validation sessions with you a lot. Your experiences, insights, and enthusiasm about Circular Economy energise us. We are grateful for your generous support and help. Meanwhile, we hope the shared knowledge here could add value to your work. Further, it is exciting to see this validation brings several potential collaboration opportunities!
</p>

<p>
We are now preparing the official report about this model. Soon, we will share the final version of the detailed results with you after we finish this second (final) round of feedback collection.
</p>
